Memory: 4kB;
Architecture: 8-bit;
opcodes: 35, 2 bytes long;
Registers: 16 8-bit named Vx, x in [0,F], and 1 16-bit register I
            I used to store addresses (12 bits long, stored in rightmost bits)
            VF is unused by programs, used a falg store

            2 special purpose 8-bit registers for sound and delay timers

            PC is 2 bits
            SP can be 1 bit(?)
            The stack is an array of 16 16-bit values. Chip-8 allows for up to 16 levels of nested subroutines
Display: 64x32 monochrome display; ( 0,0 ) ( 63,0 )
